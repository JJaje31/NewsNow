# News Now
This is a news aggregator that uses Node.js, Express, and React. This app is strictly built for my portfolio/Git Hub for potential employers/recruiters.

## Features
Use the drop down menu to see the list of catagories of different news options. From there will bring you to a page with titles on cards and a button that displays a modal to get a description of the article. From there you can either visit the actual website by clicking the card or the button on the bottom right of the modal to visit the website.
